cfs-access-point
=========================

This is a Meteor package used by
[CollectionFS](https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS).

You don't need to manually add this package to your app. It is added when you
add the `collectionFS` package. You could potentially use your own access point
package instead.
